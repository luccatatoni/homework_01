## Overview and Origin

* Ripple (“Company”)

* Founded: 2012

* Founders: Arthur Britto, Chris Larsen, Ryan Fugger

* Total funding amount $293.8M via Seed Round, Series A, Series B, Series C.


## Business Activities:

* The idea was conceived to propose secure payment options via a global network. **Extracted from [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs)**:

> Ripple provides one frictionless experience to send money globally using the power of blockchain. It offers a global real-time payment system that enables banks and financial institutions around the world to directly transact with each other without the need for a central correspondent. 
The company also offers FX Market Making, a solution enabling enterprises to gain access to cross-currency liquidity through a distributed network that allows foreign exchange to be externally sourced from a competitive FX marketplace or an internal FX trading desk. This minimizes FX exposure thereby lowering the volatility and counter-party risk of trades. Ripple Insights features industry updates, insider perspectives, and in-depth market analysis.

* **According to their [website](https://ripple.com/faq#)**: 

> Ripple is the only enterprise blockchain company today with products in commercial use. Our global payments network, RippleNet*, includes over 300 financial institutions across 40 countries and six continents. We work with regulators, governments and central banks—not against them—to improve the way the world moves money.
Through the use of blockchain and modern APIs, Ripple enables financial institutions who are part of the network—RippleNet—to send money globally, instantly, reliably and for fractions of a penny. Being part of RippleNet solves three key issues with payments:
>    1. Speed and certainty
>    2. Liquidity management
>    3. Transparency

> *With RippleNet, customers can quickly access new markets, expand their services and deliver the best customer experience in global payments today. With a single connection, customers can access the best blockchain technology for global payments, payout capabilities in over 40 currencies, On-Demand Liquidity ** as an alternative to pre-funding and operational consistency through a common rulebook.
> International payments, especially in emerging markets, require businesses to hold pre-funded accounts in destination currencies. It’s a costly endeavor that ties up resources. RippleNet provides an alternative. While any financial institution on the network enjoys reliable, instant and lower-cost transactions, those who use the digital asset XRP to source liquidity can do so in seconds—freeing up capital and guaranteeing the most competitive rates available today.

> **On-Demand Liquidity enables RippleNet customers to leverage the digital asset XRP to bridge two currencies in three seconds, ensuring payments are quickly sent and received in local currency on either side of the transaction. XRP is ideally suited for global payments because it is quicker, less costly and more scalable than any other digital asset.

>Over 300 financial institutions around the world rely on Ripple’s growing global payments network, RippleNet, to process their customers’ payments anywhere in the world instantly, reliably and cost-effectively. Customers include: MoneyGram, American Express, PNC, Santander, SBI Remit and BeeTech, to name a few.

* Technology: Ripple is written in C++. More information of their technology can be found [here](https://github.com/ripple)

* **Not to mistake: Ripple and XRP.** Ripple is a technology company which provides solutions for sending money globally whilst XRP is an independent digital asset. More information on this [link](https://ripple.com/insights/difference-ripple-xrp/)


## Landscape:
* **According to [GVR](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/digital-remittance-market):**
> The global digital remittance market size was valued at USD 16.28 billion in 2020. It is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.3% from 2021 to 2028. The growth in payment automation and digitalization is expected to propel market growth. Numerous digital-savvy customers across the globe are opting for digital remittances, thereby driving the market growth. These customers are opting for digital remittances owing to their reduced transfer time. Rapid growth in urbanization and industrialization is drawing the inhabitants of various rural and semi-rural areas to urban parts. Numerous people are moving in search of employment or education to different countries and locations. This, as a result, increases the number of cross-border transactions. This, in turn, is expected to fuel the market growth.

> The use of digital remittance services offers high protection and privacy for consumers. As numerous financial institutions and banks across the globe are opting for a data-driven and transparent ecosystem, these services are anticipated to emerge as the preferred mode for remitting money. Numerous banks and financial institutions across the globe are focusing on expanding the reach of their business networks so that everybody can have access to their financial and banking services. Moreover, customers prefer these services owing to low remittance costs.

> Customer demands are expected to define the pace of the market over the forecast period. In recent years, the digital money transfer has received a wider acceptance among customers in low- and medium-income economies. Rapid urbanization and increasing incomes are vital factors for the prominence of digital remittances. The ease of digital payments has caught on largely due to the mobile apps and penetration of smartphones.

> The outbreak of COVID-19 is anticipated to have a positive impact on the market. The COVID-19 pandemic forced everyone to make major adjustments to the way they work, live, and communicate. The need for international digital remittances is expected to increase owing to global restrictions on movement. Also, customers are turning towards digital wallets as it is the most effective, quickest, and convenient way of transfer money overseas since the lockdown began.

## Recommendations
* Ripple is on the right track to be successful. Its platform is already operational and the Company has a large and interesting base of clients. It is just a matter of being broadly accepted by the regulators worldwide. 

* Some concerns, however, need to be watched closely, such as the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple Lawsuit. More information [here](https://www.coinbureau.com/analysis/sec-ripple-lawsuit/)

* It would be interesting to have an interface to send/receive remittance as easy as Venmo, but worldwide and with competitive FX rates. The remittance market has a huge size and it could become the next best thing. It is not reinventing the wheel, but just a tweak to use Ripple's network to provide an additional service to its customers.
